This e-commerce project aims to develop a robust and user-friendly online shopping platform using PHP for backend scripting and MySQL as the database. The primary goal of the project is to provide an efficient digital marketplace that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products seamlessly. The website will cater to a diverse audience by offering a range of products across multiple categories, with functionality that allows users to register, log in, manage their profiles, add products to a shopping cart, and complete purchases through a secure payment gateway
